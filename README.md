**`superintendent`** provides an `ipywidget`-based interactive labelling tool
for your data. It allows you to flexibly label all kinds of data. It also allows
you to combine your data-labelling task with a statistical or machine learning
model to enable quick and practical active learning.

## Getting started

Take a look at the documentation: http://www.janfreyberg.com/superintendent/

It has some explanations of how the library works, and it also has many
examples.

If you'd like to try the library without installing it, check out the
[repository on binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/janfreyberg/superintendent/master?filepath=examples.ipynb).

## Installation

```
pip install superintendent
```

If you want to also use the keyboard shortcuts for labelling faster, you will
also have to enable the ipyevents jupyter extension:

```
jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix ipyevents
```

If you also want to run the examples, you need three additional packages:
`requests`, `bs4` and `wordcloud`. You can install them via pip by running:

```
pip install superintendent[examples]
```

If you want to contribute to `superintendent`, you will need to install the test
dependencies as well. You can do so with
`pip install superintendent[tests,examples]`
